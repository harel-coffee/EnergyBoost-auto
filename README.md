# EnergyBoost: Learning-based Control of Home Batteries

<img src="logo_RGB.png" alt="EnergyBoost logo" width=300px margin="auto" />

## Description
EnergyBoost is a software program that runs on a Raspberry Pi.
It utilizes accurate supervised learning models 
for predicting the next day available solar energy and household demand, and 
physical models that closely approximate the output of a solar inverter
and the state of charge (SoC) of a lithium-ion battery. 
It formulates the control of battery charge and discharge operations 
as an optimal control problem over a finite time horizon.
This problem is solved using model-based and model-free control techniques.

* [Add history](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/blob/master/data_processing/add_history.rb) will match data for each time slot with its history data of previous time slot and data one week before, these data can be used as features for prediction.

* [GHI model figure](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/blob/master/data_processing/ghi_model_fig.py) and [HL model figure](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/blob/master/data_processing/hl_model_fig-more.py) compare differnt models for predicting ac power and home load and generate a plot showing the nRMSE of different models.


* [GHI model](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/blob/master/data_processing/ghi_model.py) and [HL model](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/blob/master/data_processing/hl_model.py) train the best models for all homes predicting ac output and homeload. The trainted models are saved so that it can be used repeatly without training again.

* [Get preidct data](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/blob/master/data_processing/get_predict_data.py) call the saved models from last step and saved pridicted home load and ac output for each home. It merges the predcit two values with other features of states and save the output as `predicted_data/predicted_hhdata_<home id>.csv`.

### [Baseline](https://github.com/sustainable-computing/EnergyBoost/tree/master/Baseline)
